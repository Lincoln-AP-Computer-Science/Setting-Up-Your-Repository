After the entering the new page, name your repository `AP-CS-XXXXXX-Your-Name`, where XXXXXX is your student ID and Your Name is your first and last name. Similar to this:

Once your rename your file, be sure to also check off `Initialize this repository with a README`. This is important because it will allow you to directly create new files without having to do any complicated steps. Once you check it off it should look like this:
