# Setting Up Your Repository

Now that you've set up your account, you can proceed to make your repository where you will store your files.

On the [Lincoln AP Computer Science group page](https://github.com/Lincoln-AP-Computer-Science), click on the big green `New Repository` button, or click the one shown below. It should look like this:

After the entering the new page, name your repository `AP-CS-XXXXXX-Your-Name`, where XXXXXX is your student ID and Your Name is your first and last name. Similar to this:

![Repository Name](img/Repository%20Name.png)

Once your rename your file, be sure to also check off `Initialize this repository with a README`. This is important because it will allow you to directly create new files without having to do any complicated steps. Once you check it off it should look like this:

![README Checkbox](img/README%20Checkbox.png)

After that, click the big green `Create Repository Button` that looks like this:

Now that your repository is created, you should see a `README.md` file in the file explorer and a top bar with a `Create new file`, `Upload files`, and `Find file` buttons. Click on the `Create new file` button.

You will now need to create three folders: `PP` for Programming Projects, `classwork` for classwork, and `homework` for homework. To do this, after clicking the `Create new file` button from before, type `<folder>/` into the `Name your file...` input box, where `<folder>` is the name of the folder you need to make. It will end up like this: 

![Create Folder](img/Create%20Folder.png)

If your scroll to the bottom to commit your file using the `Commit new file` button, you will notice it is grayed out like this:

![Cannot Commit](img/Cannot%20Commit.png)

This is because you will need to create an actual file, not just a new folder. Back in the `Name your file...` input box, type `placeholder`.

The `Commit new file` button should no longer be grayed out. Click on it to finish.

![Can Commit](img/Can%20Commit.png)

Repeat this for all three folders.
